# JAVA 8 - Training

## Introduction

The aim of this repo is to provide some exercises to train practicing java 8.
Examples will focus on some design pattern or using stream api. 
One of the main objective is to show that java 8 writing can be simpler than java 7 one's.
Convincing sceptical people that java 8 has really great functionality and every one should at least understand how it works !

## How does the repo works?

The master branch has some examples of implementations in java 7. 
The codebase is covered with some unit tests so that refactoring should be safe !
The objective is to refactor the entire codebase with java 8 functionality.

## Is there a "solution" for people struggling to refactor?

Yes there is. I implemented every functionality in java 8. You can check it out using the "java_8" branch.
I don't pretend it's the only way to refactor the codebase, but that's one way to do it =)
